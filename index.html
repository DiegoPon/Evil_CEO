                  To my child,
                  <br><br>
                  If you are reading this, then I am already dead, but I want you to know that everything I ever did,
                  every
                  choice I ever made, was for this family and for this company. As I am writing this I am old, I am so
                  old
                  that my fingers ache with every keystroke, but I am enduring this pain for us, for our legacy. My
                  child,
                  soon you will be taking over my company, and with that comes a lot of responsibility. I know you may
                  not
                  understand yet why I made the choices I did in this life. You may not understand why I was never
                  around,
                  why I missed your every birthday party and soccer game, or whatever the hell it is you played, but
                  soon
                  you will know the true meaning of hard work. If I didn’t make those hard choices, like leaving you out
                  in
                  the pouring rain every day after school and whatnot, then the industries and inventions this country
                  takes for granted would never have come to be. Where would we be as a society without our Halloween
                  Candy
                  (Now With Razorblades already Inside!), and without our latest invention, the breathmint that allows
                  you
                  to bypass your car’s breathalyzer even when blackout wasted? These are the kinds of things you need to
                  start thinking about, child.
                  <br><br>
                  If you ever do have a family, though if I remember correctly precisely what you look like that may not
                  be
                  a problem, but if you do, you will need to act like I did for the good of this company. You will spend
                  long hours in your office doing real, important work. You will be doing the things that matter, like
                  inventing the next <span class="chromatic_text">Puppy Grinder 3000</span>, and making sacrifices on
                  the things that don’t, like your
                  anniversary or other frivolous family matters like that. Before I go I want to say that I am so proud.
                  I
                  am so proud of my company and all the work we have done for this world. I’m also proud of you too, I
                  guess. I want you to know that wherever you go, wherever you take this company, I will be in the next
                  life always looking up at you. Now you go out there and you restore our name back to its former glory.
                  <br><br>
                  And one last thing before you go: I left some of my most prized belongings in the corner of my office,
                  which I suppose is now your office. Do your old man a favor and don’t touch my shit. You always screw
                  something up or break something so im telling you now don’t touch anything. Alright, ciao.
