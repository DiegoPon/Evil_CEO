                  To my child,
                  <br><br>
                  If you are reading this, then I am already dead, but I want you to know that everything I ever did,
                  every
                  choice I ever made, was for this family and for this company. As I am writing this I am old, I am so
                  old
                  that my fingers ache with every keystroke, but I am enduring this pain for us, for our legacy. My
                  child,
                  soon you will be taking over my company, and with that comes a lot of responsibility. I know you may
                  not
                  understand yet why I made the choices I did in this life. You may not understand why I was never
                  around,
                  why I missed your every birthday party and soccer game, or whatever the hell it is you played, but
                  soon
                  you will know the true meaning of hard work. If I didn’t make those hard choices, like leaving you out
                  in
                  the pouring rain every day after school and whatnot, then the industries and inventions this country
                  takes for granted would never have come to be. Where would we be as a society without our Halloween
                  Candy
                  (Now With Razorblades already Inside!), and without our latest invention, the breathmint that allows
                  you
                  to bypass your car’s breathalyzer even when blackout wasted? These are the kinds of things you need to
                  start thinking about, child.
                  <br><br>
                  If you ever do have a family, though if I remember correctly precisely what you look like that may not
                  be
                  a problem, but if you do, you will need to act like I did for the good of this company. You will spend
                  long hours in your office doing real, important work. You will be doing the things that matter, like
                  inventing the next <span class="chromatic_text">Puppy Grinder 3000</span>, and making sacrifices on
                  the things that don’t, like your
                  anniversary or other frivolous family matters like that. Before I go I want to say that I am so proud.
                  I
                  am so proud of my company and all the work we have done for this world. I’m also proud of you too, I
                  guess. I want you to know that wherever you go, wherever you take this company, I will be in the next
                  life always looking up at you. Now you go out there and you restore our name back to its former glory.
                  <br><br>
                  And one last thing before you go: I left some of my most prized belongings in the corner of my office,
                  which I suppose is now your office. Do your old man a favor and don’t touch my shit. You always screw
                  something up or break something so im telling you now don’t touch anything. Alright, ciao.

         <p id="Gt">They say no good deed goes unpunished, and whether it be a result of your reluctance to 
            do evil or your particularly philanthropic spirit, you have lost your company and you are now 
            financially destitute. You have been formally censured by the entirety of corporate America,
             blackballed from every industry and rendered a pariah amongst the people you once called peers,
              coworkers, subordinates, and shareholders. Maybe you can yet make a nice life for yourself as
               a monk or perhaps a youth guidance counselor, but you’ve failed your father, your company, 
               and your shareholders. [COMPANY NAME]’s bankruptcy has left a void in the job market so vast that a quarter of the 
               nation’s economic sector has crumbled and the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to heights once unforeseen. 
               You are broke, alone, and hated in the nation, but your spirit remains unburdened.

         <p id="Nt">Everyone hates you and you are definitely, unambiguously, just unpleasantly evil, but you do 
            the occasional good thing to the detriment to yourself and your shareholders. Your reluctance to give 100%, 
            to fully commit to the hedonistic, machiavellian pursuit of pure and absolute evil for the good of your [COMPANY NAME] 
            and your wallet has left a vacancy in the market cornered by a new, more sinister corporation. Their products unleash 
            a level of suffering and misery your consumer base only dreamt in their most tormented and cold-sweat-inducing nightmares, 
            and the ruthless iron fist by which their executives run their operations puts your comparatively pitiful attempts at 
            corporate dictatorship to shame. Your father accepted a deal with the devil where he would endure an extra 500 years 
            in the molten copper Hell shower to send you a personal invoice formally relinquishing his custody of you, opting instead
            to adopt your competitor’s CEO as his honorary child. Enjoy second place, and you better believe your now ex-father is going to
            give you a stern talking-to when your mortality finally catches up with you and you are dragged to Hell to meet him. Thanksgiving 
            will be awkward.

      <div id="evil_ending">
         <p id="Et">As you walk into your office for another no doubt productive day, the swirlings of hell with tormented screams 
            and the cracklings of a raging inferno echo through your executive suite. The smell of sulfur and charred corpses 
            flood the office as a writhing portal lined with the flesh of the damned tears a hole through the fabric of reality
             (as well as the newly painted drywall of your office) and with it emerges Satan himself, bearing with him a but a single
              slip of paper and a tasteful fountain pen. He tells you he is impressed with your work, that your unyielding display
               of evil and your dedication towards the misery of your fellow man has piqued his executive sensibilities. 
               He slides the contract over to you, inviting you to continue your work for the rest of eternity. 
               With the flick of your pen you are bound both in ink and blood to ensure that [COMPANY NAME] will dedicate its 
               unique propensity towards evil to make Hell more miserable than even Satan himself could muster, and you will do it 
               for the rest of time. That means you will be going to Hell too, of course, but what's that compared to an office job in corporate America?
